## üìñ Development Journey

This portfolio was built on **Replit** with the assistance of **Replit AI** through an iterative development process. After completion, the project was downloaded for local deployment.

### What We Built
- Professional portfolio with education, experience, research, and skills sections
- Modern React website with responsive design
- CV download functionality
- Professional photo integration

### Development Process

#### Phase 1: Initial Setup on Replit
- Replit AI analyzed CV and requirements
- Built React + TypeScript portfolio with modern UI on Replit platform
- Integrated user content and professional photo
- Used Replit's development environment for coding

#### Phase 2: Content Integration
- Added SKEMA Business School education details
- Included specific projects: IoT Security System, Heliostat Mirror positioning
- Added IEEE Secretary and volunteer experience
- Refined skills section based on user feedback

#### Phase 3: Download from Replit and Deployment Challenges
- Downloaded project files from Replit as tar.gz package
- Extracted files locally for deployment

**‚ùå GitHub Pages Issues**
- Multiple GitHub Actions workflows attempted
- Build script conflicts (backend + frontend together)
- 404 errors due to file structure problems
- Several workflow configurations tested but failed

**‚ùå Error Messages We Got**
```
Dependencies lock file is not found
npm scripts disabled on Windows PowerShell
Build process generating wrong file structure
404 File not found on GitHub Pages
```

**üîß What We Tried**
1. Modified GitHub Actions workflows multiple times
2. Changed build commands to frontend-only
3. Fixed Windows PowerShell execution policy
4. Debugged file structure issues
5. Tested different deployment configurations

**‚úÖ What Finally Worked**

**Local Build Process:**
```bash
# Install Node.js from nodejs.org
# Fix PowerShell if needed:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Build the website
npm install
npm run build
```

**Netlify Deployment (Success!):**
1. Go to netlify.com
2. Drag contents of `dist/public/` folder (not the folder itself)
3. Get instant live website
4. Customize URL in settings

### Key Lessons Learned

**What Worked:**
- Netlify drag-and-drop deployment
- Local build process with proper Node.js setup
- React + TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for rapid styling

**Challenges Overcome:**
- GitHub Pages static hosting limitations
- Windows PowerShell script execution restrictions
- Build configuration separating frontend/backend
- Correct folder structure for deployment
